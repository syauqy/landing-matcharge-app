# Wetonscope Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** August 1, 2025

Welcome to Wetonscope. Your privacy is a sacred trust, and we are committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application (the "App"). Please read this policy carefully.

### 1. Information We Collect

To provide you with personalized and insightful readings, we collect the following information:

- **Personal Information:** When you create an account, we ask for your birth date, birth time, and email address. This information is essential for us to calculate your Weton and provide the core functionality of the App.
- **Usage Data:** We collect anonymous data about how you interact with our App. This includes which features you use most often, session duration, and general engagement patterns. This helps us understand what is most valuable to our users so we can improve the App.

We do **not** collect your precise location data.

### 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect for the following purposes:

- **To Provide and Personalize Our Services:** Your birth date and time are used exclusively to generate your Weton, Wuku, and other related readings. Your email address is used to secure your account.
- **To Improve Our App:** We analyze anonymous Usage Data to understand user behavior, identify popular features, and make improvements to the App's functionality and user experience.
- **To Communicate With You (Future Use):** In the future, we may use your email address to send you occasional updates about new features, new readings, or other information related to Wetonscope. You will have the option to opt out of these communications.

### 3. How We Share Your Information

Your privacy is paramount. We do not sell your personal data. We only share information with third-party service providers under the following circumstances:

- **For Product Analytics:** We share anonymous Usage Data with **PostHog**, our product analytics provider. This helps us analyze how our App is being used so we can make it better. This data is anonymized and is not linked to your personal email or name.

### 4. Data Storage and Security

We take the security of your data seriously. Your information is stored on secure servers provided by **Supabase**. We use industry-standard security measures, including those provided by Supabase like authentication and database access controls (Row Level Security), to protect your data from unauthorized access.

### 5. Your Rights and Choices

You have control over your personal information.

- **Access and Update:** You can access and update your information within the App's settings.
