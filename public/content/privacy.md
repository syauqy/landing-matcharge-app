# Privacy Policy for Matcharge

**Last Updated:** October 11, 2025

Thank you for using Matcharge ("we," "us," or "our"). We are committed to protecting your personal information and your right to privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and what rights you have in relation to it.

### 1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?

We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you register on the app, as well as information that is collected automatically.

#### Personal Information You Disclose to Us:

- **Account Information:** When you choose to create an account by linking your Google or Apple account, we receive your name, email address, and profile picture as provided by those services.

- **Subscription Data:** We collect and store the subscription information you manually enter into the app, including the service name, price, billing cycle, first bill date, and category.

#### Information Automatically Collected:

- **Anonymous User ID:** When you first use the app, we assign you a unique, anonymous identifier through Firebase Authentication to store your initial data locally. This ID is not linked to your personal identity until you choose to create a permanent account.

- **Usage Data:** We may collect information about how you interact with our app for the purpose of improving our services.

#### Purchase Information:

All in-app purchases are processed through Apple's App Store. We use a third-party service, RevenueCat, to manage subscription status. We do not collect or store your payment card details.

### 2. HOW DO WE USE YOUR INFORMATION?

We use the information we collect to:

- Provide, operate, and maintain the core functionality of the Matcharge app.
- Sync your subscription data across devices if you create an account.
- Manage your subscription status (free vs. Pro).
- Communicate with you, including sending you service-related notices.
- Improve the app's performance and user experience.

### 3. WILL YOUR INFORMATION BE SHARED WITH ANYONE?

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information to outside parties. Your data is stored securely in Google's Firebase platform. We only share information with third-party service providers (like RevenueCat) to the extent necessary to provide the app's services.

### 4. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?

We use Google Firebase, a secure and industry-standard platform, to store and protect your data. While we take all reasonable measures to protect your information, no electronic transmission or storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

### 5. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?

You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time. You can delete your account from the Settings page within the app, which will permanently delete all associated data from our servers.
