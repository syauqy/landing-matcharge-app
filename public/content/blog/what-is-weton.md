If you’ve ever felt that your standard zodiac sign only tells part of your story, you’re on the right track. Weton is a system of self-discovery from the island of Java, Indonesia, that offers a much deeper, more personalized perspective. It’s a way of understanding your energetic DNA.

The system begins with a simple but profound idea: the energy of the day you were born creates a unique blueprint for your soul. This isn't just about the month you were born in; it’s about the specific vibration of the exact day.

Unlike Western astrology which uses a 12-sign system based on the sun's yearly cycle, Javanese wisdom combines two different calendars that run at the same time:

- The familiar seven-day week (**Dina** or _Saptawara_)
- A mystical, five-day Javanese market cycle (**Pasaran** or _Pancawara_)

This combination creates a 35-day cycle, meaning there are **35 unique Weton archetypes**, each with its own specific personality, strengths, communication style, and life path.

Your Weton is not a vague prediction; it is your energetic signature. It’s the starting point for understanding your natural tendencies, your ideal career, how you connect with others, and how you can live a life that is in true alignment with your deepest self.
