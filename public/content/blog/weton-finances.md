Your relationship with money is deeply personal and is strongly influenced by your innate energetic signature. Wetonscope offers a unique perspective on your "financial DNA," helping you manage your resources with greater self-awareness and intention.

### Discovering Your Natural Money Style

Your **Weton Archetype** reveals your default settings when it comes to money. Are you:

- **A Natural Saver (_Gemati_)?** You find security and satisfaction in watching your resources grow and are careful with every expense.
- **A Generous Provider?** Your first instinct is to use your money to care for and support the people you love.
- **An Investor in Experiences?** You value travel, learning, and new experiences over material possessions.
- **An Accumulator of Assets?** You are naturally drawn to building wealth through tangible assets like property or business ownership.

There is no "right" or "wrong" style. The key is to understand your natural tendency so you can manage it consciously.

### Understanding Your Financial Karma

Deeper layers of your blueprint, like your **Rakam** (Karmic Path) and **Pancasuda** (Fortune Factor), provide insight into the overarching themes of your financial journey.

- A factor like **_Tunggak Semi_** suggests a natural resilience and an ability to regenerate wealth.
- A factor like **_Lebu Katiup Angin_** points to a lifelong lesson in learning how to create stability and hold onto your resources.

By understanding these patterns, you can move from an unconscious relationship with money to a conscious one, building a path to prosperity that is in true alignment with your soul's purpose.
