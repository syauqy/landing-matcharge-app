Now that you understand your Weton "your daily energetic signature" we can explore a much deeper layer of your blueprint: your **Wuku**.

If your Weton is a snapshot of your personality, your Wuku is the epic myth that your soul was born into. It is the sacred story and spiritual context of your birth week.

The Javanese Pawukon calendar is a 210-day cycle, which is divided into 30 different "weeks" or chapters. Each of these 30 chapters is a Wuku, and each one lasts for 7 days. Your birth date falls within one of these 30 Wuku, and its unique story profoundly influences your character, your destiny, and your life's purpose.

Think of it like this:

- **Western Zodiac:** You are one of 12 signs in a 365-day cycle.
- **Weton:** You are one of 35 archetypes in a 35-day cycle.
- **Wuku:** You are born into one of 30 sacred stories in a 210-day cycle.

Each Wuku has its own set of symbolic patrons, a guardian deity, a tree, and a bird that act as your spiritual guides. Discovering your Wuku is like finding the lost chapter of your personal mythology.
