Many people who are new to Wetonscope wonder how it relates to Western astrology, the system they already know and love. Both are profound and ancient systems for self-discovery, but they come from different perspectives and offer unique, complementary insights. One is not better than the other; they are simply different maps of the self.

Here is a breakdown of their key differences.

### The Cosmic Source

- **Western Astrology** is heliocentric, meaning it is based on the Earth's 365-day journey around the Sun. Its primary reference points are the planets and the twelve constellations of the Zodiac that lie along the sun's path. It is a system rooted in the vastness of the cosmos and celestial bodies.
- **Weton** is calendrical, meaning it is based on the confluence of specific time cycles as they are experienced on Earth. Its primary reference points are the interlocking 7-day and 5-day weeks of the Pawukon calendar. It is a system rooted in the quality and energy of time itself.

### The Core Archetype

- **Western Astrology** gives you a **Sun Sign**, which is one of 12 powerful archetypes that describes your core identity and ego. This is the foundation of your astrological chart.
- **Weton** gives you a **Weton Archetype**, which is one of 35 much more specific archetypes. This provides a highly nuanced and detailed picture of your personality, innate character, and behavioral patterns.

### The Deeper Layers

- **Western Astrology** finds its depth in a **natal chart**, which is a map of the sky at your moment of birth. It analyzes the positions of all the planets, their placement in the 12 houses (representing areas of life), and the angles (aspects) between them. This provides incredible psychological depth.
- **Weton** finds its depth through a series of **derived calculations and symbolic patrons.** It analyzes your _Wuku_ (your sacred birth week with its own deity, tree, and bird), your _Laku_ (your elemental persona), and your _Rakam_ and _Pancasuda_ (your karmic themes and fortune factors). This provides incredible narrative and spiritual depth.

### Complementary Wisdom

Ultimately, the two systems are like two different expert consultants looking at your life. Western astrology is like a brilliant psychologist, offering deep insights into your psyche, your motivations, and the broad chapters of your life. Weton is like a wise spiritual guide and life strategist, offering detailed insight into your day-to-day energy, your innate character, and the most auspicious ways to navigate your path.

Many find that using both systems provides the richest and most complete picture of all. We encourage you to see Wetonscope as a new, powerful map to add to your journey of self-discovery.
