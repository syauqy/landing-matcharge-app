In a world full of career advice, Javanese wisdom offers a simple but profound starting point: the most fulfilling work is a natural extension of who you are.

Instead of asking "What job should I do?", Weton encourages you to ask, "What kind of energy do I naturally bring to my work?" By understanding your innate blueprint, you can find a career path that feels less like a struggle and more like a state of flow.

### Aligning with Your Archetype

Your **Weton Archetype** reveals your core professional strengths.

- An archetype like **"The People-Centric Explorer"** might thrive in roles involving diplomacy, networking, or international relations.
- An archetype like **"The Low-Key Intellectual"** might find deep satisfaction in research, data analysis, or a specialized craft that requires deep focus.

### Working with Your Element (_Laku_)

Your **Laku**, or elemental persona, is your guide to your ideal work _style_. This is crucial for avoiding burnout in the modern workplace.

- A **Fire** person (_Laku Api_) needs a dynamic environment with clear goals and opportunities for leadership.
- A **Water** person (_Laku Banyu_) thrives in roles that require adaptability, empathy, and providing counsel. A rigid corporate structure could feel stifling.
- A **Wind** person (_Laku Angin_) is perfectly suited for the modern gig economy, freelancing, or project-based work that involves variety and change.

The goal is not to find a specific job title, but to find a role that allows you to honor your natural energy. When your work is in harmony with your soul's blueprint, you unlock not just success, but deep and lasting fulfillment.
