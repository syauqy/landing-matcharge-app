The magic of your Weton comes from the interplay of two distinct cycles, like two gears turning together to create a unique moment in time. Understanding these two calendars is the key to unlocking your blueprint.

### The Seven-Day Week (_Dina_ or _Saptawara_)

This is the calendar you already know: Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. In Javanese wisdom, however, these are not just names. Each day carries its own specific energy and a numerical value known as a _Neptu_. For example, Sunday carries an energy of quiet contemplation, while Monday is associated with action and movement. This seven-day cycle provides the broad strokes of your personality and your outward-facing character.

### The Five-Day Market Week (_Pasaran_ or _Pancawara_)

This is the mystical heart of the Javanese system. The _Pasaran_ is an ancient five-day cycle that runs concurrently with the seven-day week. It represents the spiritual "flavor" or "vibe" of a day. The five days are:

- **_Kliwon_** (_Kasih_ - Grace): Symbolizes standing tall, presence, and spiritual connection.
- **_Legi_** (_Manis_ - Sweet): Symbolizes turning back, reflection, and sweetness.
- **_Pahing_** (_Jenar_ - Yellow): Symbolizes facing forward, clarity, and directness.
- **_Pon_** (_Palguna_): Symbolizes sleeping, rest, and renewal.
- **_Wage_** (_Cemengan_): Symbolizes sitting, grounding, and contemplation.

When your _Dina_ (e.g., Monday) combines with your _Pasaran_ (e.g., _Kliwon_), they create your unique Weton: _Senin Kliwon_. This combination of your outer personality and your inner spiritual flavor defines who you are.
