Every Wuku has a team of spiritual guides that offer wisdom about your life's path. Understanding these three patrons reveals the deeper purpose behind your personality and talents.

### Your Guardian Deity (_Dewa_)

This is the divine patron or guiding spirit of your Wuku. The deity's character, whether they represent justice, creativity, compassion, or knowledge, reveals your higher purpose and the core virtues you are here to cultivate. They are the source of your innate strengths and the teacher of your most important life lessons.

### Your Tree of Life (_Pohon_)

This symbol represents your talents, resources, and your role within your community. It is the source of your shelter and your strength.

- A large, shady tree (like a Banyan) suggests you are a natural protector and leader.
- A tree that bears valuable fruit means your purpose is to share your unique gifts and skills with the world.
- A tree with strong wood suggests resilience and a firm character.

### Your Spirit Bird (_Manuk_)

This is your "spirit animal," symbolizing your aspirations, communication style, and how you pursue your ambitions.

- A high-flying bird (like an Eagle) points to lofty goals and a visionary spirit.
- A beautiful songbird suggests your path is one of art, communication, and bringing joy.
- A water bird might indicate a person who finds their fortune near water or through emotional intelligence.

Together, these three guides offer a profound map for understanding your soul's journey.
