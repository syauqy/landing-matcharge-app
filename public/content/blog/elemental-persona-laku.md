While your Weton is _what_ you are, your **Laku** is _how_ you are. It is your elemental persona, your soul's natural way of moving through the world. It reveals your intrinsic rhythm, your behavioral style, and your instinctual approach to life's challenges.

Your Laku is derived from your total _Neptu_ value and aligns your character with a powerful natural force. Understanding your Laku helps you to stop fighting against your nature and start living in a state of flow.
