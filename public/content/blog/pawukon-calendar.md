When you think of a calendar, you likely think of the 365-day Gregorian calendar that governs our modern lives, or perhaps a lunar calendar that follows the cycles of the moon. **The Javanese Pawukon calendar**, which is the foundation of Wetonscope, is something entirely different. It is not designed to track seasons or agricultural cycles; it is a spiritual almanac, a complex and beautiful map of cosmic energy.

The Pawukon is a unique 210-day calendar, and its origins are rooted in Javanese mythology. Legend tells of a king named Watugunung who had 27 wives and rebelled against the gods. After his defeat, the gods honored his wives by creating a system to commemorate them and to ensure that the disharmony he created would never be repeated. This system became the Pawukon calendar, a guide for maintaining harmony between humanity and the cosmos.

The structure of the Pawukon is a masterpiece of interlocking cycles. Its 210-day length is the result of multiplying the 30 different 7-day weeks, known as _Wuku_, that make up the cycle (30 x 7 = 210). Within this framework, several other cycles run concurrently, like celestial gears of different sizes turning at the same time. These include:

- **The 10-day week (_Dasawara_):** Sri, Pati, Raja, Manuh, Duka, Manusa, Raksasa, Suka, Dewa, Pandita
- **The 9-day week (_Sangawara_):** Dangu, Jangur, Gigis, Nohan, Ogan, Erangan, Urungan, Tulus, Dadi
- **The 8-day week (_Astawara_):** Sri, Indra, Guru, Yama, Ludra, Brahma, Kala, Uma
- **The 7-day week (_Saptawara_):** Redite, Soma, Anggara, Buda, Wraspati, Sukra, Saniscara
- **The 6-day week (_Sadwara_):** Tungleh, Aryang, Urukung, Paniron, Was, Maulu
- **The 5-day week (_Pancawara_):** Paing, Pon, Wage, Keliwon, Umanis
- **The 4-day week (_Caturwara_):** Sri, Laba, Jaya, Menala
- **The 3-day week (_Triwara_):** Pasah, Beteng, Kajeng
- **The 2-day week (_Dwiwara_):** Menga, Pepet
- **The 1-day week (_Ekawara_):** Luang

The confluence of all these cycles on any given day is what gives that day its unique energetic signature. While the lunar Javanese calendar tells a farmer when to plant rice, the Pawukon calendar tells a person the energetic "weather" of the day.

It is a tool for understanding character, navigating relationships, and finding the most auspicious moments for important life events. It is a system designed not to measure time, but to understand its quality.

By engaging with Wetonscope, you are tapping into this ancient stream of wisdom, learning to live in greater harmony with the cosmic rhythm of the universe.
