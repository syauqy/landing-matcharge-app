    question: "Do I need to connect my bank account to use Matcharge?",
    answer:
      "No, and that is by design. Matcharge is a privacy-first, manual tracker. We believe that manually adding your subscriptions creates a moment of mindfulness, helping you truly be aware of your spending. Plus, it means you never have to share your sensitive banking login credentials with us.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can Matcharge cancel subscriptions for me automatically?",
    answer:
      "Matcharge acts as your personal financial dashboard, giving you the clarity to make decisions. While we don't log into your accounts to cancel them for you (which would require sensitive access), we provide the links, reminders, and data you need to cancel unwanted services quickly and easily yourself.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is Matcharge free to use?",
    answer:
      "Yes! You can download Matcharge and track your subscriptions for free. The free version includes essential features like the Zen Garden visualization, basic tracking, and reminders. For power users who want deeper analytics and customization, we offer Matcharge Pro.",
  },
  {
    question: 'How does the "Zen Garden" visualization work?',
    answer:
      "Most finance apps are just stressful lists of numbers. Matcharge visualizes your expenses as a digital Zen Garden. Each subscription is represented as a pearl—larger pearls mean higher costs. It allows you to see where your money is going at a glance, without the stress of spreadsheets.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does the app support multiple currencies?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Whether you pay for Netflix in USD, Spotify in IDR, or a news service in EUR, Matcharge supports tracking across multiple currencies. We handle the conversions so you can see your total monthly spend in your primary currency.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is my data safe?",

  },
  {
    question: "Can I export my data?",
    answer:
      "We know many users love their spreadsheets! We are actively working on a CSV export feature for Matcharge Pro users, which will be available in an upcoming update.",
